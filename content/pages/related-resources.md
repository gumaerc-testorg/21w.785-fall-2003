{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
A typical example of a misuse of Macromedia® Flash™. Upon viewing this website ask yourself the following questions: What is the background supposed to be? Why is the window so small? What are the whirling polygons and sliding panels saying about Janet Jackson or her product? What is the little animated graphic in the top-right hand corner supposed to convey? If you are left unsure as to the answer of any of these questions, that is because the website has been designed to be glitzy, and at some point lost sight of its purpose. What is good about the site is the interactive sound features and actual audio and video content, but that's programming and musical talent, not web design.

{{< tdopen >}}
A lot of effort was clearly put into this website, but why does the user need to see so many copies of the same images that stream up and down the screen as you move your mouse around? It is actually pretty hard to navigate this website, and even harder to discover the message behind nikelab.com, and what it is actually promoting, other than shoes. Text is far too small in places, and unnecessary information about loading modules is displayed to the user. In an attempt to appear futuristic, these features are more of an annoyance than anything else.

The Apache™ HTTP Server Project is an effort to develop and maintain an open-source HTTP server for modern operating systems including UNIX® and Windows® NT. The goal of this project is to provide a secure, efficient and extensible server that provides HTTP services in sync with the current HTTP standards. Apache™ has been the most popular web server on the Internet since April of 1996. The August 2002 Netcraft Web Server Survey found that 63% of the web sites on the Internet are using Apache™, thus making it more widely used than all other web servers combined.

The Common Gateway Interface (CGI) is a standard for interfacing external applications with information servers, such as HTTP or Web servers. A plain HTML document that the Web daemon retrieves is static, which means it exists in a constant state: a text file that doesn't change. A CGI program, on the other hand, is executed in real-time, so that it can output dynamic information.

This edition offers full cross-platform and cross-browser coverage. This book does not focus on the more complex aspects of DHTML, but focuses on practical examples of what really works with DHTML and CSS, making it useful for beginners just starting out with DHTML, as well as professional developers looking for a quick reference.

When Peachpit Press released the debut edition of JavaScript™ for the World Wide Web: Visual QuickStart Guide, it immediately became one of the most useful tools for busy Web developers. Now in its fourth edition, this book has been improved, expanded, and more finely tuned.

Written for Web coders who have at least some familiarity with HTML, the book doesn't necessarily require you to have knowledge of JavaScript™ programming or scripting. The presentation is illustrative and productive, and concepts are introduced via practical examples, explained briefly, presented in code, and then explained line by line. Using judicious screen shots and new code highlighted in red, the authors have made JavaScript™ for the World Wide Web quite intuitive. In this new edition, they point out features compatible with only certain Web browsers using new IE and Netscape® icons. Along with its core content, the text includes an excellent genealogy of the various flavors of JavaScript™, complete with an extensive object flowchart that is colorcoded by browser version. It also steps outside the base language with a chapter on visual development tools that use JavaScript™, like Dreamweaver®, GoLive®, and Fireworks®. There are tons of useful scripts in the book, and the publisher provides a companion Web site where you can get each script, as well as an interface for viewing the code in action. You can download all of the scripts in a single Zip file. This is simply a must-have guide to JavaScript™.

Edward Barrett, Deborah A. Levinson, Suzana Lisanti
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
Most books on Web design focus on the appearance of the finished product and pay little attention to the ideas and processes involved in intelligent interactive design. This book is based on the premise that the principles that have defined good communication design in the past apply equally well to the Web. The basic process is one of defining the purpose, audience, and style appropriate to one's objectives. Another premise is that effective Web site design is an inherently collaborative process requiring not only technical skills but more traditional written and oral communication skills. Hence, this book stresses a social, process-oriented approach both to design and to classroom instruction.

This book is written by Prof. Barrett himself and contains a lot of invaluable information for succeeding in the class. It even contains details of your assignments, and of his expectations for your projects! Worth looking at.

New edition of a resource that shows how to create useful new scripts or adapt existing ones to individual needs. Castro (author of several books about the Web) tells how to set up and install a local server in order to learn Perl and test scripts without signing up with a commercial Web host; place forms on Web sites that collect and process user input such as product orders and comments; use CGI.pm, the standard Perl module for analyzing incoming form data; and how to debug and use security techniques.
